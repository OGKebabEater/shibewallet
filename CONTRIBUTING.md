/* CONTRIBUTE */

This is the contribute.md of doughwallet. Great to have you here. Here are a few ways you can help make this project better!

## Breadwallet

Doughwallet is a fork of Breadwallet (http://github.com/voisine/breadwallet), so it’s important to know where to contribute features, patches and bug reports.

## Adding new features

ll features that would improve the wallet in a bitcoin context should be contributed to Breadwallet first and will then merged to Doughwallet afterwards. 

Features that are specific to dogecoin or the spirit / community of dogecoin should be contributed here.

## Bug triage

Bugs you can also reproduce in Breadwallet should be reported there, bugfixes for those will be merged to Doughwallet afterwards. If you think you found a bug that is specific to Doughwallet, please report it here and mention that you can’t reproduce it with Breadwallet.

If you are unsure / unable to test in Breadwallet, please report the bug here, but don’t be discouraged if the bug will be fixed in Breadwallet first.

## Beta testing

Doughwallet uses Apple’s TestFlight for beta testing. Use the beta tester application form at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13Qk2do6XH4QmJxQqDtHukRbL5iormfo0G1SF9oUas2c/viewform to be part of the beta test. You’ll receive an email once a new beta version is available for testing.

## Translations

If you want to help translate Doughwallet to your language, please contribute a translation to Breadwallet first. We’ll merge that back to Doughwallet and then translate the strings that differ. This saves work and we get a consistent language across the two applications.
